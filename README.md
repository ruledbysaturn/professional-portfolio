# professional-portfolio
## Description

- This project was to create a portfolio that I can build off of and add to throughout my time in this coding bootcamp. I think this project helped me understand some of the concepts we've learned so far a bit better.

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```
